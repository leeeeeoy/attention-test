this drink is perfect and that is just that
yum carbonated fruit juice
surprisingly good for soda
decent enough but pricey
overly sweet orange soda
tasty mildly carbonated fruit juice soda
kind of like faygo or slice
switch to the switch
good alternative to regular orange soda
tinged with vitamin
metallic sweet bad aftertaste
great orange soda without being too sweet
kids love it this healthy choice
nothing special
really very tasty
it is good but pretty much tastes like orange soda
just pretty good
different maybe better
the motto of this drink fits
high sugar acidic taste not ready to make the switch
tasty lightly carbonated good alternative for soda pop
mostly good
drink healthier without the yucky taste but at cost
very tasty soda alternative
makes your mouth happy and bubbly
ho hum it is ok
good tasting orange soda
very good
like an orange juice
great flavor
not what expected
really good flavor surprisingly soda like for being juice product
not bad
my favorite flavor
not too sweet but not full juice taste
one of the better sparkling juices
our family is huge fan of izze and this was right in line with that the flavor was not too sweet and refreshing my favorite
nothing like they promise rather nasty tasting
nothing special
wonderful
sweet and delicious
light and refreshing
more like liquid candy in can
orange soda flavor with real fruit juice
awesome taste and healthy too
great natural orange taste tough price
switch has true tangerine orange flavors but it is too sweet despite having no added sugars
apfelsaftschorle for americans
switch umm no
the true un soda
nothing earth shattering enjoyed it though it lacks bite
not the best switch flavor
thick drink with strange taste
it is an ok drink
totally delicious
sugar free version needed
bit too sweet for my taste
delicious
tastes good but pay attention to the labels
not as advertised
sickening sweet
truly tastes like tangerine
kind of taste like cheap champagne
awesome soda enriched water alternative tastes great
sweet treat
pleasing orange soda tad pricy but worth it
good ok maybe
flavorful and good
glorious
the new juice
flavor winner
very nice tangerine soda
carbonated juice that tastes like orange soda with tangy tangerine chaser fleshed out by filler juices
just ok for me
drink without category
like orange soda only way better
did not deliver on the hype
refreshingly lite natural drink
not as tasty as it could be
ok but not my fav
little funky but not bad
pricey sugar okay taste
good taste but high in calorie
oranginaish
good flavor small serving high in calories
not bad alternative to soda but not great one either
carbonated orange juice in can
not fan has an odd taste carbonation in minimal
the switch vs soda
not terrible but would rather just have orange juice
tasty not too sweet
syrupy tasting unlikeable flavor yuk
enjoyable
refreshing
great alternative to soda
refreshing orange juice drink with kick
tasty for what it is not
tasty carbonated orange juice
tastes good and healthy and bubbly
not fruit substitute
delicious
it is all juice and it is all fun
tasted pretty much like orange soda
it is tart
tasty orange flavored beverage
tasty but expensive
not that great
was not hit at our house
great taste but
tangy less sweet
unique and pleasing taste
great surprise
not my favorite
tangerine juice soda
refreshing natural
anything orangey and tangeriney is worth try
loved it
not for me
yummy and fizzy
amazing fruit juice spritzer
combination of juice and carbonation juice no sugar no artificial flavors
fizzy and tasty but nothing special
good option
fizzlicious and tangy
delicious
great alternative to high fructose corn syrup laden sodas
tasty refuel after exercise or liven up lunch juice bad stuff
mona lisa
low carbonation juice
think slightly fizzier orangina
light and refreshing
surprisingly tasty
my least favorite of the four tried
not so good
delicious
great taste
not good enough for me to make the switch
light and tasty beverage with no hfcs
tastes good but
reminiscent of regular orange soda
switch orange tangerine ounce can
great fruit drink
decent tasting but too small and overpriced
odd tasting but natural
not so bold soda alternative
tangy orange bubbly stuff yum
wish it were either orange or tangerine
very tasty natural soda
wanted to like it more
tasty but calorific
tastes almost like regular orange tangerine soda
orange tangerine switch
too sweet for this sugar freak
of sugar still there
lame
yummy
would not switch
unless you really want vitamin in your soda not really worth it
delicious
yummy
they need to leave out the sugar next
too sweet
very good could be bit better
very harsh too sweet flavor
extra sweet and very carbonated
well it is better than the black cherry anyway
not my thing but you might enjoy
this is really good especially if you like juice
much better than regular soda
interesting switch from soda
medicine like after taste
loved this drink
the best yet
solid juice offering
very refreshing
switch orange tagerine
sweet fruity
would rather fight than switch
wish for guilt free flavor
refreshing but has unnatural aftertaste
make the switch to healthier beverage
what is it all about
had high hopes am bit disappointed
tastes like soap
ton of tangerine taste in tiny can
smooth flavor
super satisfying taste
decent carbonated fruit drink that offers healthier alternative to normal soda
nothing great about this
too sweet
nothing special
refreshing
furniture polish with an aftertaste
yuck
very juicy like
surprisingly good
taste as advertised
soda substitute that tastes similar to the original
all natural refreshment
powerful little drink
tastes like chemicals
switch flashback to my childhood bad memories man
interesting better than watermelon
nice alternative to soda
tasty orange soda
not soft drink more like carbonated orange juice
fresh light taste
excellent excellent excellent
torn
no corn syrup but way too sweet
recommend other flavors instead
crisp and suprisingly sweet drink but lots of calories and pricey
too sweet to drink uncut
small size and mediocre taste
switch orange tangerine is misnamed and perhaps bit overpriced and not diet drink
yuck
very tasty natural drink
excellent
excellent
ok soda like slightly lugubrious tang in can
not bad nothing special about it
never received the product
not bad at all
okay but
no
it is all in the numbers
did not taste great
no sugar but not low calorie
too much sugar too expensive
switch on
nice change
not bad
questionable healthy drink
it is all natural but that does not mean it is good for you
to much and not enough
strange
good ingredients weak taste
healthy drink that tastes great
good for sipping lot of sugar
cloying
sweet and refreshing
muddy orange flavor
some things were not meant to be carbonated
tasty alternative to the usual sodas
just soda
only so so
meh
great soda
going beyond sugar water co
nice fruity flavor
as jules from pulp fiction would say this is tasty beverage
pretty good
great alternative
my son favorite soda
tangy
great product
great orange bevvie
my kids love it
nice alternative
way way way too sweet of suger in oz can soda does not have this much sugar
delightfully delicious natural tasting
actually tastes like real oranges
different than regular soda
too sweet too late
tangerine drink that does not taste watery hooray for switch
really just bubbles and vitamin
tasty
they got it right
exactly what is claims to be
quite tasty enjoyable sweet carbonated beverage
it is ok not the best not the worst
good but nothing special
not bad but not enough zing
how miss the taste of sugar
really not too bad
it is okay
great taste refreshing with or without ice
excellant
not bad not great
fine citrus beverage from the switch
great taste but not new taste
not bad
naturally delicious
pricey yet surprisingly refreshing
delicious and no aftertaste
not bad but not great
uniquely tasty beverage
decent but tastes little odd
refreshing and not too sweet
now that is orange
sweet and carbonated like energy drinks but without the sugar
pretty good
very good
too much mint
my favorite

carbonated premium juice
mediocre beverage

tasty natural soda but little strong
not huge enough difference over regular juice or soda
fruity and tasty
fruiy carbonated drink
sweet soft drink
nice soda alternative but lacks little something
tarty but also sweet
it was pleasure to try
very tasty just wish there was more in the can
healthy and tasty

lots of calories and carbs
not bad drink probably best flavor out of all
love it
where is the kiwi
tasty and refreshing
good but little too sweet for my taste
swwwwweet but aftertaste
good but not enough to switch
pretty good
great taste wish calorie count was lower
pleasant tasting and refreshing
sweet fruity drink better for you than soft drinks why not just drink water
lightly carbonated and very sweet
it is like pop rocks in liquid form
not bad but it should be called the switch apple grape kiwi berry
tastes more like carbonated apple juice
small yet tasty
different flavor still pretty much unexciting
too sweet
refreshingly sweet
sweetness overload
tasty
this is what soda should be
looking for replacement for soda

not worth the money not my favorite flavor
somewhat natural somewhat like candy
refreshing but tad too sweet

great taste but little too sweet
switch beverages have good flavor
guilt free flavor
very good thing in too small package

very tastey
good tasting but bad for you
why are not all packaged fruit drinks this good
tasty and refreshing
refreshing
too sweet
ounces of expensive mixed juice
this was pretty good
drop dead delicious
liscious

bit on the sweet side
exactly what it states but nothing special
good still bad for you though
tastes great but nothing like berry or kiwi
unwholesome
new taste experience
great portable juice and great flavors
excellent make the switch
mediocre carbonated drink
if what you want of what you do not
at calories per ounces this was not what was hoping for
healthy alternative
crisp and refreshing but spendy
flavorful
really really tasty
nice taste but sugar level is high
refreshing kiwi berry beverage
serviceable substitute for unhealthy sodas
flavorful and refreshing
switch kiwi berry
healthy perhaps but expensive
like cross between soda and juice box
pleasant surprise and pleasure to drink

false advertising
not enough kiwi or berry and too much filler juices
tastes like overly sweet apple juice trader joe version is better
liquid lollipops
what do you say after you say it is vile
grams of sugar in small can

mixed review
great toy for food driven labs
great toy even after years
lbs boxer mix loves it and has not been able to chew it up
if the rope breaks it can be salvaged
keeps them entertained
good idea my dogs are not interested
nothing special
welll
very good treat dispenser
should be labled medium size dogs
good toy but best for clever pup
well made but only for the very food motivated
hard to interest my pooch
it lasted couple of hours
dog loves it
nice enough but
ouch
fun but not the way intended
cute but not westie proof
he loves it
my dog never figured this out
cool but my dog quickly destroyed it
okay guess
the rope is actually rubber chewed through it in seconds
my dog chewed this up
not as good as the previous model
great for food driven dog
pretty good but does not hold my dog interest
very engaging
better but still room for improvement
we loved it but
rubber rope gone in sec
quite the workout but maybe bit too difficult

time consumer
not bad but could have been better
not exactly self serve

destructible
good idea dog enjoyed it broke immediately

liked the design but my pup too smart for it
best toy ever
good toy
neat idea but not good for strong chewers
keeps her busy for long time
better than the buster cube almost as good as bully stick
wonderful attention keeper
keeps the pup busy
good idea one major design flaw for us
bullet proof maybe for rubber bullets
dog will not touch it
too small
not durable for chewer
my dog now prefers this to the food bowl
waste of money and time
clever idea but
my puppy does not like this too hard to get treats out
good while it lasted but it did not last
doesnt work

less than hours to chew up the rope making it useless
great for two days
not good treat dispenser
dog does not use it at all
really for bigger dogs
my dog loves everything but hates this
keeps dog entertained but too loud
not for chewer
great idea but too hard in practice

just okay low acid coffee
smooth and delicious
good enough to make me order more

was really disappointed
no acid and no sacrifice to taste
low acid coffee but needs to improve flavor
so so taste to low acid coffee
excellent cup of coffee without the after taste
nothing special
cannot review
tastes like mild everyday coffee
seems to be less acid not my favorite taste
low acid low taste
it is definitely coffee
tasted like coffee no noticeable taste difference
tastes the same as starbucks
puroast low acid coffee low acid coffee french roast ounce bags
not starbucks but not bad
low acid weak taste
delicious
tastes like decaf
worst cup of coffee ever
not bad if you need low acid coffee
cuppa joe for hearburn sufferers

less is more more or less
does the trick for me
good coffee

smooth as silk and great acid free flavor
smooth
so am trying out the coffee on the espresso machine

strange brew well received
decent alternative
loved the first one
sticking with zantac

pretty darned good
tates is strong

if you really really need the low acid then this is pretty good
pretty good but nothing special
ok but needs to be cheaper
husband says it is not very frenchy
pretty good
dark french roast it is bland and weak
good if you need it
just ok
extremely mild taste very low acidity
robust flavor
mild with nutty aroma
it does as advertised
too dark and bitter french roast from puroast
good alternative
prefer folger
strong but easier to drink
compares favorably to starbucks dark roast
perhaps if acid is huge concern
great stuff
good but lacks punch
rich taste weak aroma
based upon my wife feedback
good stuff
best low acid coffee

ho hum coffee

this coffee is not bad
tastes like regular french roast but easier on the stomach
it is give and take
wood to the last drop
excellent genuine old world first cup in the morning coffee cost is the only drawback
puroast low acid coffee low acid coffee french roast
rich dark flavor less acidic aftertaste
we found no difference from the taste of store brand coffee
taste like cheap hotel coffee
yuck
two mugs up
good coffee
mild brew for acid sufferers
will not buy again
an acquired taste perhaps
promising
excellent truly is low acid
puroast low acid coffee
oh how wanted to like this coffee
lives up to its claims
low acid true but the format is for restaurants not homes
just ok
nice cup of coffee
turns out acid makes for good coffee
still had heartburn with puroast
low acid coffee with minimal after taste
it was okay but not gourmet coffee
probably need more than one morning to really tell
soothing to stomach unappealing taste
taste great less pain
surpassed my expectations
strong and not bitter
try cup or more
mellow rich french roast
cannot tell the difference from regular french roast
the taste is good
very smooth
good for low acidic coffee
surprisingly good for none coffee drinker
little weak but did not bother my stomach

not worth it
low acid coffee hit
excellent coffee for heartburn sufferers

tasted good
puroast low acid coffee
coffee for all
if you need low acid you have found your answer
smooth and easy drinking coffee
bitter aftertaste

if you cannot drink regular coffee this blend is inoffensive
great tasting coffee
low acid smooth taste
an excellent low acid coffee
lower acid unappealing taste
smooth rich dark
not bitter but strangely acidic tasting for low acid coffee
you can doll it up
good flavor but hard to judge any acid difference
very strong coffee burnt tasting
makes decent cup of coffee
good tasting coffee
too strong tasted yukky to me smelled bad too
nice strong coffee without the stomach upset
not my cup of coffee
it does have the low acid going for it
coffee ok but price is excessive
ehh
sure was hoping
at last
the magic is in the grind
smooth but with bitter after taste
am on the fence
low in acid but low in flavor
low marks for flavor and fragrance
too strong
ph near neutral but so is the flavor
fine for an early saturday morning
can have second cup
low acid indeed but darker roast than like
smooth cup of coffee
medium bodied and smooth
super cup of coffee
wierd smell funny taste lasting aftertaste
yuck
full bodied aroma satisfying blend
low acid coffee
great if you have heartburn
good flavor
no heartburn and tasty
low acid coffee boasts high level taste
lighter coffee that tastes very good
great taste give it shot
smooth coffee with rich flavorful aroma
good coffee and convenient packaging
lose the acid without losing taste
smooth and roasty
full bodied coffee with no aftertaste
not my cup of coffee
very nice low acid coffee
if you get heartburn and love coffee it is for you
coffee it does body good
different gentle mild flavor
pleasing and mellow
good low acid option
not bad coffee but is it worth it
nothing new or different
it tastes like gasoline was the first reaction heard
this could be god sent or donau wasser depending on who you are
heaven in cup
hard to tell
has potential but really does not taste that good
too dark for me but packets good for christmas baskets
low flavor
it says pack of three ounce bags just got one
it may be low acid but it still gave me heartburn
not the best part of waking up
really good coffee and much easier on my stomach
low acid and perfect for strong coffee lovers
disappointing
coffee that is low on acid but also low on punch
puroast low acid coffee
did not like the taste
low acid high bitterness
full flavor without the burn
low acid coffee lack robust favor
weak taste you can do better than this
disappointing
in the end it is the taste that matters
average coffee no discernable difference in acid content
old world coffee for those who suffer from acid reflux
low acid but lacks flavor
sorry it is ewwwwww
decent average coffee
just okay
awful
puroast low acid coffee
good try
decent flavor not outstanding
low acid and little taste
no bitterness
an adequate cup of coffee
nice if your stomach needs the low acidity
bit bland but not bad alternative
definitely strong but with less acid
ok coffee
no acid taste
unpalatable
low acid coffee
no more antacids after drinking this coffee
will not be switching to puroast
sorry not fan
decent low acid roast but hold the french
nothing to write home about
if all you want is low acid try other beverages with data
may be good for others
like watered down weak turkish coffee
ok
weak aroma and taste just ok
low acid coffee
definitely low acid but slightly low on flavor too
tastes ok it is low acid
low acid doubtful taste aweful
unpalatable
robust
burned flavor
it even smells terrible
seriously foul coffee
not something would buy again
not what expected
just okay
no heartburn but did not like flavor
now know why dad switched
this java has no jump
ok but not as good as regular cold brewed
bland and boring
smooth though not robust dark roast
clear coffee flavor

no flavor
soft but dry and crumbly
very dry
not too bad for soft baked cookie

not so tasty
the picky eater loved these

not worth buying
suits my taste in cookies
healthy rival to cookies made by my wife mother grandma

not good
healthier alternative to most cookies
these disappeared from my kitchen though they are crumbly

more healthy than flavorful
passable soft cookie
soft tasty oatmeal cookie
quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie chocolate almond
too many calories for one tasty cookie
tastes good
not enough chocolate chunks
not bad but will not buy again
for specific times and specific reasons maybe
tasty but dry
delicious way to sneak some extra fiber into your day
filling but little on the dry side
oh these are good
tastes good but not as substantial as pepperridge farms
sweet
tasty and good snack size
middling
soft baked is catchier than crumbly blandness
tasty maybe if you enjoy the taste of sawdust and cardboard
not craving this mediocre cookie
kinda dry not too sweet nothing special
know it is cookie but
not for me
soft but on the dry side
usually sucker for soft cookies
soft and tasty
great taste

smooth and dignified
serious chocolate for the kid in you
disappointing
smooth not too sweet very good though bit simple for hard core chocoholics
ok
ethically responsible and organic but there are other brands to try to figure out what tastes best to you
it is dark chocolate and therefore its fine choice
delicious taste and profits go to charity
chocolate excellent newman own great but vine only sent bar
my new favorite dark chocolate bar organic and slave free
creamy but not special
meh mediocre dark chocolate
great tasting dark chocolate am fan
good dark chocolate if you like that kind
not just organic environmentally responsible
pretty average
not impressed
it is just ok
tasty enough but too hard
decent not fantastic
marred only by initial waxiness
an average bar of chocolate
good chocolate organic to boot
chocolate lovers should like this
good dark chocolate but not great
good dark chocolat but bit sweet
cocoa selection that split our household on taste try one before making big investment
perfect
not dark enough

too restrained for dark chocolate lovers
the lighter side of dark chocolate
possibly the best dark chocolate ever
great but even darker might be better for my taste
too sweet for me
yummy

delicious
creamy tasty but not too chocolaty

not for those who like smooth taste
good taste
my sweet tooth is not quite that sweet
delicious
not calorie worthy
yummy
mm mm good
am interested in the health properties of dark chocolate
expected more from newman own than this
not worth the extra money
okay but even cadbury is better
skip this bar
better than no chocolate but not as good as one might hope
dark but not deep
good noms
tasty
love your movies paul but not your dark chocolate

not my favorite snack to be sure
cocoa powder coated almonds subtle crunchy delicious
delightful burst of chocolate flavor
good almond taste
decent almond snack but it pales to marconas
just touch of cocoa
tasty and something different
chocolate flavor antioxidants winning combination
perfect for low carb diet
unique and tasty but not quite sure about ingredients
okay
delicious and not too sweet
subtly sweet
convenient healthy snack
really not what expected
great cocoa flavor
great snack toasty and crunchy with just hint of chocolate
this is what call balance
the perfect topping for summer treats
interesting twist on almonds
good but not very cocoa flavored
filling snack with just light touch of cocoa
excellent taste without whole lot of extra calories
just right bit of flavor over and above
delicious
thes things grow on you
double your pleasure
fantastic and healthy snack

dark chocolate lovers healthy dream come true
tasty but not low fat snack
good almonds but where is the chocolate
pretty good nuts
amazingly addictive
healthy chocolate snack can it be
nuts about nuts
chocolate flavored nuts but not really
tasty healthy snack
that is tasty little sucker
delicious twist on traditionally salted almonds
yum

chocolate almonds for the price of regular ones amazing
tasty snack
very tasty almond treat
sooooo yummy
two great tastes come together in healthy snack
healthy chocolate like almonds
chocolate coated almonds but not in the normal way
less guilty then real chocolate coated nut
superb snack but artificial flavor added
am coo coo for coca nuts
tasty not too sweet snack
sinfully great taste
not sweet enough the first time but it got better
was surprised
an easy decision
like almonds and like dark chocolate

the flavor has me starry eyed
almond candy bar without the candy
richy chocolate nutty goodness
not what expected but in good way
tasty
good almonds
pleasantly surprised
lovely but also light
tastes fake
good despite faint terrible fake sugar taste
not very good at all
good treat for party but pricey for everyday munching
chocolate almonds match made in heaven
nuts about em
little too much
the subtle and sophisticated chocolate almond
actually love the tast of these
potentially dangerous ingredient acesulfame
decent taste crap ingredients mixed with nuts
great chocolate alternative
lowfat chocolate anti inflammatory goodness
so so for me raw almonds are better
good idea but too bitter for my taste
yummy
perfection
emerald cocoa roast almonds disappear from kitchen
almonds are good
marriage made in heaven
wonderful take on almonds
excellent idea and great taste
almost there
pleasant surprise
interesting take on chocolate and nuts
no mess for chocoholics
imagine snacking on almond flavored cocoa puffs and you are just about there
almonds covered with dark chocolate
taste one and you will not stop
tastes like sucralose yuck
nuts to me
love the hint of chocolate and without the carbs
pure cocoa taste with crunchy almonds inside
great tasting and healthy
cocoa and almonds winning combination
like my nuts can not lie
blech
very bad after taste from artifical sweetener
an almond ruined
absolutely horrible
an unforgettable eating experience maybe someday will be able
repulsive
it never arrived and the tracking shows in sa for days now
terrible taste like cocoa puffs breakfast cereal bad
beware artificial flavors
weird
great healthy snack
two tastes that do not mix well
toasty tasty treat
somewhat dry but pleasant enough alternative to chocolate coated nuts
did not care for this
cocoa almonds
way to much splenda on these
beware artificial sweeteners
these almonds have me sitting on the fence
great taste and convenience questionable ingredients
when nuts to you is good thing
cocoa almonds
good product but pricing change abused
bought whole bunch of these in early they are still fresh
simply amazing concept
heaven for low carbers and almond addicts

real shot in the arm
so so
the illy issimo caff tastes good if you like black coffee
yuck
faux coffee real heartburn
approved by an old school coffee snob
drink is not bad but the caff flavor is not to my taste
potassium bicarbonate as finest natural ingredients

thoughts from an experienced illy drinker
good if you like quick cold coffee type beverage
it is good
illy stands for refreshing coffee drinks to me
not my favorite
too sweet and rich
you have to really like iced esspresso to drink this
very strong not too sweet and packed with energy only calories
good but
for fans of cold espresso aka brand doubleshots
bitter but refreshing
cold espresso no
light and mellow
dislike it
thanks but will pass
yea not so much

convenience stars taste stars
potent but the taste is not for me
good taste after few sips
little intense

for the coffee hound
strong and flavorful but too sweet for me
illy issimo coffee drink

skate with the big boys
eden foods shitake mushroom
surprisingly good
beneficial blend
gracious green goodness
six stars if could
great tea not so great packaging though
celestial seasons green tea superb
celestial seasonings
not simply green tea
not authentic should be called green tea blend
packaging confuses
not bitter but smooth
most delicious drink
nice and smooth
celestia has big hit with this one
this tea is not what it seems
best cashews in the land
great flavor
great cashews
nothing special
tasty snack but cashew flavor is overpowered
odd taste combination
heavy seasonings get your attention
spicy and tasty
great snack
very good
and better
love regular salted cashews and these were tasty but
you really need to like pepper for this product
my six year old likes them
these are very very tasty
just as expected
good pepper too salty
tasty treat
spicy tasty snack
fairly good
not the nut for me
if you need kickier snack
big and fresh nuts tasty
sea salt and pepper too much just right yes and yes
cashews
who knew cashews could be so powerful
tasty almost too tasty
too much salt pepper
not big fan of pepper
yumm
good snack but bit hard on the tummy
well roasted tasty crunchy rightly peppered but bit too salty
not the best flavor combination
too salty for most
it is cashews
can be appealing but do not overeat
pepper cashews
good but spicy
yummy
like the idea but
tasty and packs peppery punch
toothsome crunchies
super salty
good but not that great
too much salt and pepper
instant hit
strong flavor with room for improvement
tasty alternate to peanuts or almonds
interesting in small doses
different
tasty but little too strong
decent nuts
dry fresh and tastey
they are salty they are peppery and they are delicious
aw nuts addicted
wow uniquely emerald
savory tasty
addicting
nice distinctive tasting treat for cashew lovers
they are okay nothing to scream about
delicious
savory snack
very salty and peppery
very tasty few at time
sea salt nuts
nice twist on an old favorite
recommended with one reservation
cashew taste masked by too much pepper
delicious
if they eliminate the pepper would recommend this product higher
too salty and peppery for me
perfect snack
great
too salty for me but
really good cashews surprisingly
exquisitely tempting
you cannot eat just one
too salty
not bad but not quite what thought it would be
delicious
strong salt and pepper taste
unique nut that bites back
simplicity is underrated
flavorful versatile nice twist
spicy hot and addictive
sea salt and pepper with hint of cashews
fair
pepper on cashews is great
salt pepper cashews
not for sensitive taste buds
great twist on cashews
unbelievably good
it is all about the pepper it just sneaks up on you
spicy cashews are tasty and addictive but bit too salty
nut licious and pepper lover dream
salt of the earth sea
for committed salt and pepper lovers only
for pepper freaks only
wow these are flat out great
cashews with zoom and zing
someone turned up the heat
tasty
too much salt and pepper
love cashews but these are overly salted and peppered
no
excellent nuts ruined by an intolerable seasoning
not for cashew lovers
very disappointed
ruins good cashew
overwhelming
delicious nutritious but high calorie
emerald sea salt pepper cashew ounces
perfect mix of salt and pepper
am cashew purist but
me no likey
rich and bold
good stuff
sea salt and pepper nice change of pace
disappointment
simply irresistible
pepper pow
really good nuts overpowerd by the seasoning
these are miss
three ingredients to love for
perfect combo for beer drinking
too salty to handle
love the cashews but little salty
yummy
an unusual flavor combination
interesting flavor strangely addictive
although wary actually enjoyed these
delicious yum
very disappointing
suprisingly good
good idea but
an acquired taste
pleasant surprise
not bad
zesty and flavorful
pretty good
good little overpowering
excellent
gift for my worst enemy
spicy
nuts for these nuts
grab this can of fantastic cashews and do not let go
cashews are very fresh but much too salty sea salt questionable
pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop
granulated onion and sugar pepper icky taste does not make any sense to call these sea salt and pepper flavor
should be called onion and salt cashews
good cashew ruined
tasty cashews somewhere under all that seasoning
peppery little bite
good but could be better
charlie cashew sez coulda been contender
too salty
too salty
purchase only if you have more willpower than me
should be called onion sea salt pepper cashews
hint of salt and pepper
spicy nuts
too salty
cancer survivor snack food
il too salty
way too much seasoning both pepper and salt
like cashews bet you cannot eat just one
only if you really enjoy processed foods
too salty
not just salt and pepper onion and mystery spice too
simple but delicious combo unless you do not like pepper
too salty
salty and very hot
too salty little too oily and overpriced
strong kick takes away from natural taste of cashews
too salty and peppery for my taste
bartender best friend
uninspiring taste unpleasant texture
strangely exotic treat that grows on you but bring water
too salty and too peppery cashews
how could they do this to cashews
bold but not for me
very heavy on the salt
salty
peppery is the word
way too much pepper
hold the pepper
no improvement over the almonds
spicy flavor almost totally hides the taste of the cashews good for snack with beer
excellent with reservations
excellante
good nuts roasted and seasoned just right
maybe too much pepper but good flavorful snack
delicious in small doses
tasty
not for the faint of heart
cashews with kick
fantastic but you would better love pepper
perfectly peppery
less really is more
pimp my cashew
one word nasty
winner in the office
like mouthful of pepper
wow never expected the taste on this
agreed over the top seasoning
much too salty
come on please
salt pepper and onion
nice change
inconsistent product
warning these nuts contain genetically modified ingredients
delicious
sea salt and pepper heaven
great product but inconsistent
too much of good thing
flavorful nice kick from the pepper
do not like cashews but love these
cashews to die for
who would have thought
somewhat disappointed
love them
if anything too salty
perfect taste coming from desi
sea salt and pepper tastes like sea salt and pepper

not too sweet
too sweet and artificial tasting
definite strawberry taste but no real tea or acai taste
tastes like melted popsicle
nice flavor but does not really taste like tea
do not use as directed this product needs diluted
sweet drink
mango pineapple are nice but delicioso on ice
way too sweet
mixed reviews from my family
simliar product to what is already on the market
like kool aid
refreshing but oh that aftertaste
misleading and far too sweet
tasty but bit too much splenda for my taste
nice blend of flavors and no real after taste
not bad has bit of weird aftertaste though
might be bit too sweet for most palates
this one is not all that good
blah taste
good taste but fatally flawed
yuk
kool aid for adults
simultaneously bland and artificial tasting
artificial tasting and yet another sweetener in it
fake sugar fake flavors
its like kool aid for adults
weird after taste
very sweet little misleading
this is tea really
sucralose
better than most
strong artificial taste plus another synthetic sweetener in it
not bad but not the best
ok but would not go out of my way for it
have been duped
disappointed
you can really taste that sucralose
fruity blend
not fan
iced not so hot
cannot find the tea
delightful brew
finally can drink lipton tea again
fun beverage but takes time to dissolve

great

nice shampoo
like it
tingling burning sensation after use
seems like an excellent shampoo
is shampoo just shampoo
met our expectations
think there is conditioner in this shampoo

nourishing for thin hair makes it full without the residue
fine shampoo for decent value
works great for fine hair
excellent
does the job but not much better than other brands
very nice shampoo
not anything special
nice scent and texture
used times now
goes to great lengths
little goes long way
so far so good

mixed results for fine thin hair
outstanding
clean shampoo has pungent perfume scent works ok as shampoo

does the job but not for everybody
good hair days
shampoos well but did not give me volume

makes your hair fall out
as the hair gets thinner
too heavy
nice
left my hair dirty
not clear enough
lovely shampoo
seems to do what it claims with nice mild fragrance
good product
very light and bouncy hair
expected something well clear
smells great and makes your hair look great
smells great cleans well but is not volumizing
silky not volumizing
nice shampoo not really volumizing though
unbelievable literally
love this shampoo
leaves hair bit dry
silky
nothing exciting
fantastic surprise
good shampoo not spectacular specialty
shampoo
works as shampoo not sold on volumizing roots
not bad but not for colored hair
might be good for others but not me
nice fragrance good quality and fair price
outstanding
rinses clean not oily
creamy shampoo that really is different
your curly hair will love you for using this
just so so shipping issue as well
hair is soft and looks full shampoo smells like the
serviceable shampoo perhaps better suited for buying in person
mixed feelings poor packaging hair decent
love this shampoo
really does add little volume
not impressed
smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and full bodied
can see myself using this shampoo conistently
volumizes but might fade color
my wife absolutely loves it
great for fine hair
every bit as good as scalp version
leaves hair so well cared for you will feel way younger than your years
did get some volumizing curls seemed to last longer
great for short fine hair
does good job
very nice with an issue or two
works great for my thin baby fine hair
seems very good though not cheap
great results
clear and clean
not for fine hair
thickens hair as advertised
great shampoo creamy with nice scent
has been working well in conjunction with the volumizing conditioner
the winner for the not yet ready for marketing is

this is not just erythritol
depends what you use it for
bake with it
organic zero is amazing
super substitute
great alternative to sugar
bought mine for baking with terrific results
sugar like texture without the sugar blues
terrible for sweetening tea
warning not organic anymore
not considered natural in the rest of the world
spendy but non corn source is worth it
umm this is just very expensive erythritol
just like sugar
does not dissolve not sweet tastes like tin foil
great for tea not too sweet
wholesome sweeteners
organic zero review
okay not too sweet
sweet safe and organic
aside from the price this is great stuff
expensive and irritated my throat
organic zero
gi distress
orgainic zero wholesome sweetener
good alternative

good flavor but does not stand out
tastes smokey and artificial

pointless fat and calories
smoke and spice how nice
meh

senior drinks
not too hot
tangy and tasty
great taste
great topping for chicken
good but mild
surprisingly good
heavy on smoke and vinegar
used as sauce for chicken
falls short on flavor
it is hard to believe that something that tastes so good has taco bell on the label
delicious
do not read the nutrition label just enjoy
high calorie high fat hot
delicioous and not only on tacos
not to shabby
creamy but not bold
add smoky zest to your food
sauce that is easy to like
nice change of pace
taco bell at home
something bold and unique
hot sauce meets salad dressing
did not work for me
lava sauce on the go
really good much better than expected
well they got half of it right
okay chipotle sauce
creamy not too spicy versatile
passable utili sauce
very mild
decent flavor for quick fix

so much sodium
definite pass
not just like taco bell but still really good

you have definitely had bolder chipotle sauce but this will do in pinch and makes decent substitute for ketchup mayo etc
neither bold nor spicy
tasty
tasty sauce great on veggie burger

not craving it
this is actually quite good
we did not enjoy this sauce
taco bell hits the trend for home use

tasty when used sparingly
my new favorite sauce
kind of an interesting taste but nothing crave
it is ok
tasty and versatile
resturaunt style sauce for the home
tastes good little goes long way
yummy with little bite
pretty good but not sure what to do with it yet

real tasty but that is it
ok but not convinced
meh think ill stick with monster
good tasting pick me up
meh it is okay
badass can does not make you into bruiser
tastes good
very effective
no fear super energy supplement
do not usually care for energy drinks
great taste
not for me
good flavor and no rush but plenty of smooth energy
the taste is good but is the science
tastes good and give you the umph
decent enough prefer low cal versions
woo doggie
nothing outstanding
okay taste questionable energy
no fear unless you are scared of dishwater
love em
not bad but will not make me change brands
tastes great and really packs punch
better tasting less energy big oz can
just enough
just another energy drink tastes slightly better than average
am afraid no fear is not for me
taste fruity but if you drink coffee you will not feel thing
perfect boost for the day
super energy drink bad taste
pleasant taste that does not match the packaging
taste the energy
another energy drink
tastes good effects comparable to red bull and monster
does the trick
fear
the taste test was draw in our household
similar to nos or orangina in flavor
this stuff is winner
nice flavor not so great energy
ok drink ambiguous flavor
sugar rush
hey the can has cool look and like the taste but
nice energy booster
great taste gives good sugar caffeine rush
no fear super energy supplement ounce cans
no fear
nice tasting and boost of energy
so excited
not bad
new favorite energy drink
teenagers perspective just so so
good taste
taste is better than some energy drinks have tried and it is got the usual ingredients for boosting energy
fortified crasher
go for the sugar free version
it works
not my favorite but it does work
more energy or just sugar high
so so
tastes better than most energy drinks
tastes ok
drink with zing
taste fine but lacks punch
decent energy drink
great taste
sweet pink grapefruit juice flavor great energy boost
good taste provided lift
eh not bad but not fan
an energy drink not health supplement do not be confused
great fruit flavor
tastes good and provides quick pick however also contains lot of sugar
delicious and refreshing
it is pretty good and it works little better than most other energy drinks
great choice
fruity taste high priced
great tasting and good kick without making me shaky
new no fear super energy supplement is worth try
distant runner up to monster
no fear of the supplement some fear of the price
better than others have tried
good taste bad value
great taste wrong description on page
great stuff and someone bought the company and is supposedly reproducing it
awesome
best energy drink period
love this product
outstanding
best energy drink ever
awesome drink

just ok
too much grapefruit flavor
good taste for an energy drink
get your fix the right way
great taste powerful boost
woke me up
great if packaged correctly awesome energy drink
tastes good
good but not great energy drink
fear the flava
no fear super energy supplement works if you can get past the taste
the only thing setting it apart is the skull
better than sucking sugar from straw
low fiz taste makes no fear good buy
will stick with hour energy drinks
typical energy drink
what is to fear
best tasting energy drink have ever had
not pricey foul taste
servings per container no energy boost for me
shareable size but flavor is meh and no kick
oily kool aid
not for me
ewwww
why would anyone drink grams of sugar in one can
meh
excellent tasting awesome energy drink
one of the worst drinks for you
no fear
holy sugar
pretty good
pretty good stuff
liked it so well bought the company
no fearing this energy drink
not the energizer bunny
yucky tasting and high in sugar carbs and calories
look elsewhere
does the trick
great flavor and no after taste with decent energy
pumps energy taste could be improved
did not like the taste or the calories
did not seem all that different from other brands
do not have the energy to get another
ok guess
oh boy another energy drink
did not enjoy the taste at all
not the best
leaves an aftertaste do not care for
too many calories and too strong taste
great taste in this servings per can of no fear energy drink
my husband liked it
flavor is just fair
good taste
great flavor recommend
it does the job
really how many sugar carb packed energy drinks does this world need
good taste frozen but over of sugar
tastes terrible and made my heart jittery
big on sugar low on everything else
pretty darn good
new citrus taste
best energy drink out there
the best energy drink ever
no fear
yuck
utterly average energy drink
not for me
fear no fear
not sure about this product
you will have more energy than the average housecat
not very healthy
it works like it says
would rather drink dew
way too sweet and taste terrible
nice energy boost followed by hard sugar crash
one should not consume anything that shares the universal logo for poison
no fear
do we really need another energy drink or any energy drinks at all
bad taste not much energy
do not fear the no fear
how about nice hawaiin punch
gave this to my yr old to try
jittery saccharination
not bad has some ups and downs
large canned energy drink with good taste
nice scent and taste in intimidatingly heavy duty packaging
cannot taste the taurine
much much better taste
unique flavor that surprisingly liked
good flavor but not the greatest ingredients
does the job but does not stand out as better than other energy drinks
tasted great worked well
all that sugar and no real boost for me
kept me awake without the jitters
tastes good not like vitamin
mostly high fructose corn syrup
not bad not bad at all in fact pretty good
ok taste no noticible energy boost
no fear says it all
have no fear super energy is here
please bring back
excellent product and service
all have to say is hell yeah
amazon must save no fear
dont get no better
best tasting energy drink out there
no fear here go for it
good stuff
second to none
not bad for big can energy drink
remember when skull on the label meant do not drink the contents
no fear energy drink
buy it for taste above performance
fear the no fear
unable to finish the can highly artificial medicinal flavor
no fear energy drink why did they take the fear away

tasty and zippy
great taste good energy

average
dorky name but taste is better than most

good carbonated juice product but light on the black cherry
not bad at all
pretty good if you are juice fan
nice fruity flavor
it is okay
refreshing natural drink
tasty alternative to soda
wow excellent flavor
mona lisa
only little bit more good for you than sodas
the switch but from what
nicely packaged bubbly applejuice
lightly carbonated juice cocktail
very expensive fruit juice
good
apple cherry
refreshing soda without all the bad stuff
love the black cherry
yr old tried it
not as good as kiwi berry
drink that lives up to its promise
great alternative to soda
refreshing and just the right amount
pleasingly natural but bit candy sweet
this is small portion too sweet not enough tang for cherry soda
ounces of expensive mixed juice
juice natural flavors carbonated to perfection
deceptively tasty
liked another switch but not this one
definitely not shasta
not bad but it should be called the switch apple grape black cherry
not too sweet with true cherry taste
weird
juice pouch with fizz
nice refreshing light taste
delicous healthy beverage
not bad but not great either
the best switch flavor
it is tasty but would rather drink soda
sweet but healthier alternative to colas
carbonated juicy juice
refreshing marketing tool
not that bubbly
tasty but too sweet
natural
verry cherry
excellent alternative to regular cola black cherry switch
little lackluster
truly outstanding
like drinking cherry pie
excellent flavor
soda that is not
bright clean black cherry taste
well whoopty do not good value pure marketing gimmick
carbonation makes percent juice lighter taste is bit off
syrupy
tasted fermented
juice sparkling water sparkling taste
yet another
wow much better
very enjoyable taste too bad it has of carbs
great tasting alternative to high fructose corn syrup based sodas
not for me
pricey sweet colored water
black cherry
nothing that sets it apart
it may be healthier soda but not tastier one
taste is only fair not worth the money
really good
step down in sweetness from soda but still has lot of sugar
so what cha what cha what cha want
great flavor but too high in sugars
kiddy soda pop
inedible
fresh tasting soft drink all juice no sugar added
mild but good flavor more cherry smell than taste pricey
the switch
juice pop great for cocktails
light pure but small
very good alternative to your typical soda
very tasty light and refreshing small serving
at best it is just ok
surprisingly good
good alternative to soda
switchin it up
time to make the switch
super delicious
fizzy and refreshing worth try
apple with hint of cherry
tasty juice

soda juice ii
delicious but too small but then it is just as well

another great flavor my family likes it
the true un soda
tasty but full of calories
the best drink ever
have switched
favorite flavor
we love the black cherry
it is tasty
not really the best of either world
juicy and delicious
nothing special
not the best taste
switch maybe not
delicious but too much sugar
juice
absolutely wonderful
black cherry soda without the sugar
loved it
pretty good stuff
cherry really
pricey but delicious
too sweet for me
good but nothing spectacular
why
switch
tasting and other notes for switch
if you like heavily medicinal tasting soft drink with long lasting unpleasant aftertaste then switch black cherry is for you
tastes good but so do other soft drinks
calories for oz of beverage
yum but
good taste
black cherry
no nasty artificial anything
not bad little drink
better than the orange tangerine version but still little too tutti fruiti for my taste
amazing cherry spritzer
great concept but tastes like you are drinking vitamin
not good tasting or nutritious enough to make me change
okay alternative to soda
good initial taste
my third favorite of the four tried
not enough cherry for me
delicious and healthy
is this what black cherry tastes like
glad it is natural
not too shabby
refreshing
juice with zing
tastes like cherry syrup
mildly carbonated tastes more of apple than cherry
not bad alternative to soda but not great one either
not enough black cherry too much filler juices
healthy and refreshing drink
it is ok
good cherry flavor not too sweet
pleasant light fizz
good very cherry
taste like fermented cherry
just okay
okay but could have better taste
alternative to regular carbonated drinks
delicious carbonated beverage without harmful ingredients
excellent make the switch
bubbly fruit juice
if drank more soda would definitely make the switch
admirable idea but too sweet for my taste
tastes like libby juice carbonation
carbonated marachino cherry juice
like lightly carbonated kid juice box
like frozen juice bar
refreshing drink
delicious alternative
very good
very good soda
another drink in the switch line
juicy juice with fizz
very cherry
flavorful juice drink
tangy taste
delicious refreshing
sparkly cherry treat
do not get this flavor
know it is not soda
great flavor
grown up cherry pop
tastes like juice but not substitute
pretty good tasting not your everyday drink
real fruit juioce in can
wow good stuff very tasty but not overly tasty
very refreshing soda
better than soda pop
nice surprise
decent fruity drink
loved it great alternative to black cherry soda
tasted great only wish they gave you more
healthy alternative
black cherry is an awesome
who would have thunk natural juice tastes better than soda
pleasantly surprised
an ok flavor but not as great as expected
great soda alternative just do not like the price
excellent
if you have gotta have sweet drink
tasty soda
all natural
thought it had great taste but bit pricey
carbonated juice
with natural black cherry taste it is all about tasting the meat
great taste with hint of apple
ok not great
great
this tastes more like apples than cherries
fizzy with no artificial ingredients
pleasantly surprised
surprised by full flavor found it better than ice
mm
refreshing and easy to drink
what like and what do not like
make the switch you beverage of chioce
juicy juice with carbonation
carbonated black cherry juice in can
grown up soda mm smells like cherries
taste the final test
not worth calories
tart black cherry is refreshing
just plain sugar water
feh
delicious black cherry soda
this really is switch
dark cherry juice soda
better than expected but not perfect
bait and switch
great taste
great
great taste juice bit sweet
taste great
very delicious black cherry soda
very sweet fizzy drink
great flavor not overly powerful
soda alternative still packs powerful punch
flavorful and refreshing
bit too sweet for my liking
black cherry is an awesome flavor for an awesome drink
taste great but
make the switch
sweet and tart the switch black cherry is yummy treat but it is soooo sweet
better than soda but not better for you
switch black cherry ounce can
extremely sweet
very refreshing but not flavor that liked
ugh too sweet
wild cherry beverage
refreshing
good tasting soda nice for special treat
tasty all natural but not low calorie
great flavor and healthier than sodas
guilt free flavor
good taste right size
the switch vs soda
am ready to switch
fizzy juice
sorry switched back
uber yummy
belch juice
black cherry natural soda
better with splash of vodka
will drink but will not switch
more of the same
not so sweet but fun to drink
different new
expensive bubbling fruit juice
cute idea way too much sugar
ok little pricey
great more healthy alternative to soda pop
okay not great
tastes like apple juice
well it is nice that it does not have sugar but
reading this description you would think
not bad yet nothing great way overpriced
another great concept with not as great execution
not for me
wow better than expected
like juice box but in can with bubbles
first apple second grape and then touch of cherry flavor
carbonated juice
tasty cherry switch
at calories per ounces this was not what was hoping for
where is the cherry
delicious and not soda
very good soda alternative just expensive
they should all be called apple
nice alternative to soda
enjoyed it
good cherry flavor
great tasting drink
pretty standard fruity drink
tasty
tasty and refreshing
tasty but would not drive out of my way for it
very pleasant
not too shabby
switch does it again and unleashes the black cherry magic
not great not horrible
love it
better than soda pop any day
too sweet and does not quench thirst
not like real pop but good
switch black cherry
if you are into black cherry or cherry coke
very cherry yummy and healthy drink
my kids love it
taste is great and switch is juice
good idea so so product
pretty good but not enough beverage
alternative to colas
much better than plain juice
average tasting drink with calories
fruity refreshment
good with slight after taste
good balance of fizziness and fruity goodness
high sugar black cherry drink
so good so fresh
pretty good stuff but not enough to switch
black cherry is my favorite of the switch drinks
not so cherry
very good cherry taste but little too sweet
nice change of pace from soda
the first sip was divine after that more mundane
it is still soda
loved it

too sweet for my liking
tastes great fresh not so much reheated
ok for quick meal
love regular velveeta not these skillets

not horrible but
better than boxed helper meals

quick and tasty meal
pretty much what you would expect
for hamburger and cheese lovers

pleasant complement to chicken breast pieces
quick tastes pretty good not too unhealthy
okay but bit bland
my kids did not even want to eat this

exactly what you think it will be
not fan of velveeta
